This means that the player does not believe that there are as many cards of the suit as bid by the previous player. When a player challenges, all cards are revealed on the table and counted. The challenge is then evaluated.\r\n<br><br>\r\nIf a challenge is successful, the player who made the last bid loses the round, whereas if it is unsuccessful the player who challenged is the one to lose. Whether or not a challenge is successful is determined by how many of the suit were actually present â€“ it is successful if there were fewer than the number bid and unsuccessful otherwise. \r\n<br><br>\r\nFor example if Tom bids five hearts and Alex challenges him, that means Alex thinks there are fewer than five hearts in all the players cards. The cards are turned over and counted. In fact there were six hearts, so Alex lost the challenge and loses a card for the next round.</html>");
