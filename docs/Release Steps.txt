-Remove devMode, check that Registry, ServerRegistry and MessageUtil are pointing at the right places. 
-Update change log, check version numbers in OnlineConstants. Up server version if necessary.
-For the client: 
-Obfuscate (UNTICK SWING UI) and put both versions and the mapping file in a folder. 
-Copy across API documentation and make changes if necessary. Change the .odt file and re-export as PDF.
-Copy across the update.bat and EntropyUpdater.jar files from previous version.
-Create a shortcut to EntropyLive.jar, call it 'EntropyLive' and set the icon on it.
-Zip up all files except the following with a password, put on dropbox:
  -Entropy Strategy API.odt
  -Entropy Live (Unobfuscated).jar
  -Mapping.txt
-Put EntropyLive.jar and Mapping.txt on the server for automatic updates/log deobfuscation. Up the client version in Version.txt and call 'reset version' or drop the server - this is so deobfuscation continues to work.
-For the server, just export the jar and copy it to the aws server.
